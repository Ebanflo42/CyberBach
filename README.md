This repository is for training neural networks and regressive models on the music datasets from "Modeling Temporal Dependencies in High-Dimensional Sequences: Application to Polyphonic Music Generation and Transcription" by Boulanger-Lewandowski et al, appearing in ICML 2012.

# TODO

## Figure out whats up with the overfitting
## Implement some plotting, particular for predicted vs actual notes
## Rewrite the music synthesis side of the project
## Test alternative initializations
## See if we can remove the stupid NullContext stuff
## Rewrite README
## Plot phase portraits?
